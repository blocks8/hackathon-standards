Hackathon Inclusion Tips
===

##Why does this guide exist?

Several hackathon organizers have come forward and asked how to make their hackathons more inclusive. This is a really tough question, as we want hackathons to be accessible to everyone, but it is impossible to know what everyoneâ€™s needs are. We started this document to be an aggregation of ways to make hackathons more inclusive, and we welcome pull requests to the document with any tips you may have.


## Gender Specific Tips
* Have female shirt sizes 

* Have females (and other group underrepresented in Hackathons) on judging panels & organizing team 

* Encourage sponsors to bring female mentors

* Enforce bathroom genders (do not turn female bathrooms into male restrooms) and  if possible have a gender neutral restroom (this is for trans* folks).

* Avoid gendered language in official hackathon announcements

* Be sure females are in marketing pics/videos

* Actively disallow sexist hacks

* Have publicized procedures by which people can report code of conduct violations, and have a point person to handle complaints. 

* Do not market female-geared talks/things in pink or perpetuate other stereotypes

* Actively recruit women by reaching out to universities' women-in-tech groups and listservs


* Non-binary gender sign-up options

* Refrain from asking things like "what does it feel like to be a girl at a hackathon?" You should not be saying things that make anyone feel like they should not be at your events. 

## Dietary Needs
* Healthy food/drinks
* Ask for allergy information from your participants and utilize it to get food they can eat.

## Misc. Tips

* Have showers

* There is currently a code of conduct in place at all  MLH hackathons. Enforce [it](http://www.mlh.io/about/code-of-conduct or http://2014.bitca.mp/conduct).
